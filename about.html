            <div class="container">
                <p class="intro-box">My journey in web development began with a fascination
                     for how websites work and an eagerness to bring my own ideas to life.
                      Over the years, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and 
                      various modern frameworks and libraries such as React and Node.js. 
                      This expertise allows me to build seamless and engaging web experiences
                       that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly performant.
                    One of my greatest strengths is problem-solving. I thrive on challenges and
                     enjoy finding innovative solutions to complex issues. I believe that continuous
                      learning is key to staying relevant in this ever-evolving field, and I am always
                       exploring new technologies and methodologies to enhance my skill set.</p>
